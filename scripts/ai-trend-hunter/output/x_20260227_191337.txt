AI Trend Watch | 2026.02.27

Talking to AI friends, here is what I noticed:

1. Multi-Agent Collaboration
   Not just chatbot anymore. Multiple AI working together.
   Example: one classifies question, one checks DB, one writes reply.

2. Event-Driven AI
   From Q&A to automatic triggers.
   Example: server error triggers AI to fix itself.

3. AI Video Battle
   Seedance vs Kling vs Veo 3
   Pro tip: dont write 'cinematic', write 'UnrealEngine5+VFX'

4. AI Coding
   Claude Code vs GPT-5.3 Codex
   My take: GPT better at writing, Claude better at explaining.

My take: AI is becoming a super assistant, not replacement.
