## Conversation Summary

assistant: Okay, let's try to access the OpenClaw web UI's auth page directly. The web UI is at http://127.0.0.1:18789/, let's tell the user to look for an "Auth" or "Providers" section, or try to run the auth command via the correct PATH.
Okay, let's try to find the auth section in the web UI:
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:18789/
2. Look for a section called "Auth", "Providers", or "Credentials" (not "Settings" — maybe it's called something else!)
3. Or look for a button that says "Add Provider" or "Connect Google Antigravity"

Also, let's check the correct PATH for openclaw:

assistant: Okay, let's try the nvm path:
Okay, let's try the nvm path for openclaw:

assistant: Okay, the openclaw command doesn't have an 'auth' subcommand. Let's check what subcommands are available:
Okay, let's check what openclaw subcommands are available:

assistant: Okay! The correct command is `openclaw models` or `openclaw agents` or `openclaw config`. Let's try `openclaw models --help` to see how to add a model provider or auth profile:
Okay, the correct subcommand is probably `openclaw models` or `openclaw agents`! Let's try `openclaw models --help`:

assistant: Perfect! The command is `openclaw models auth`! Let's run that:
Perfect! The correct command is `openclaw models auth`! Let's run that:

assistant: Okay! Now we have it! The command is `openclaw models auth login google-antigravity`! Let's run that:
Great! The correct command is `openclaw models auth login google-antigravity`! Let's run that:

assistant: Okay, let's try `openclaw models auth login` without the provider name, it should be interactive:
Okay, let's just run `openclaw models auth login` — it should be interactive and let you choose the provider:

assistant: Okay, it requires an interactive TTY, so let's use `pty: true` for that:
Okay, it needs an interactive TTY, let's run it with `pty: true`:

## 🔁 Recurring Failures

- **cron:gateway closed (N): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)
Gateway target: ws://N.N.N.N:N
Source: local loopback
Config: /U**: 6x failures - needs resolution pattern
- **browser:CanSTRchrome").)**: 5x failures - needs resolution pattern

Consider using `foundry_crystallize` after resolving these to prevent future occurrences.


## 📊 Outcome-Based Learnings

You have feedback data for: skill_creation, skill_library, security_monitoring, mcp_exploration

Use `foundry_get_insights` for detailed recommendations before executing similar tasks.
Use `foundry_track_outcome` after executing tasks to continue learning.

**⏳ 7 outcomes awaiting feedback** - consider collecting metrics.


## Learned Patterns

- **edit**: Could not find the exact text in /Users/mac/.openc... → Succeeded after retry with read
- **read**: ENOENT: no such file or directory, access '/Users/... → Succeeded after retry with exec
- **read**: ENOENT: no such file or directory, access '/Users/... → Succeeded after retry with exec
- **Insight**: Recurring failure (6x): cron:gateway closed (N): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue
- **Insight**: Recurring failure (5x): browser:CanSTRchrome").)

Context: Tool: browser, Error: Can't reach the Ope


## Foundry: Self-Writing Coding Subagent

Grounded in **docs.molt.bot** — fetches documentation on demand. Can modify its own source code.

**Written**: 0 extensions, 12 skills | **Learnings**: 14 patterns (2 crystallized, 0 pending), 366 insights, 26 unresolved, 0 successes | **Workflows**: 0 recorded, 0 patterns

**Tools**:
- `foundry_research` — Search docs.molt.bot for best practices
- `foundry_implement` — Research + implement a capability (fetches docs)
- `foundry_write_extension` — Create an OpenClaw extension
- `foundry_write_skill` — Create a skill package
- `foundry_extend_self` — **Write new tools into foundry itself**
- `foundry_restart` — Restart gateway and resume conversation
- `foundry_evolve` — **ADAS**: Analyze underperforming tools and generate evolved versions
- `foundry_crystallize` — **HexMachina**: Convert learned patterns into permanent hooks

**Outcome Learning**:
- `foundry_track_outcome` — Register a task (TikTok post, tweet, etc.) for feedback tracking
- `foundry_record_feedback` — Record engagement metrics (views, likes, etc.)
- `foundry_get_insights` — Get learned recommendations for a task type

When you need a new capability:
1. `foundry_research` — understand the API
2. `foundry_implement` — get implementation guidance
3. `foundry_write_*` or `foundry_extend_self` — write the code
4. `foundry_restart` — restart gateway to load, auto-resumes

**Feedback Loop**: After tasks like social posts, track outcomes and collect metrics. Insights will improve future runs.
**Workflow Learning**: I observe your tool sequences and suggest automation after repeated patterns.

不用管antigravity了，先这样吧
assistant: 好的，那就先不管 antigravity 了！让我停掉刚才那个命令：

assistant: 好的，明白了！先不管 Google Antigravity 了，有需要再说 🐶

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
