- **cron:gateway closed (N): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)
Gateway target: ws://N.N.N.N:N
Source: local loopback
Config: /U**: 6x failures - needs resolution pattern

Consider using `foundry_crystallize` after resolving these to prevent future occurrences.

**⏳ 6 outcomes awaiting feedback** - consider collecting metrics.

## Foundry: Self-Writing Coding Subagent

Grounded in **docs.molt.bot** — fetches documentation on demand. Can modify its own source code.

**Written**: 0 extensions, 4 skills | **Learnings**: 8 patterns (1 crystallized, 0 pending), 120 insights, 12 unresolved, 0 successes | **Workflows**: 0 recorded, 0 patterns

**Tools**:
- `foundry_research` — Search docs.molt.bot for best practices
- `foundry_implement` — Research + implement a capability (fetches docs)
- `foundry_write_extension` — Create an OpenClaw extension
- `foundry_write_skill` — Create a skill package
- `foundry_extend_self` — **Write new tools into foundry itself**
- `foundry_restart` — Restart gateway and resume conversation
- `foundry_evolve` — **ADAS**: Analyze underperforming tools and generate evolved versions
- `foundry_crystallize` — **HexMachina**: Convert learned patterns into permanent hooks

**Outcome Learning**:
- `foundry_track_outcome` — Register a task (TikTok post, tweet, etc.) for feedback tracking
- `foundry_record_feedback` — Record engagement metrics (views, likes, etc.)
- `foundry_get_insights` — Get learned recommendations for a task type

When you need a new capability:
1. `foundry_research` — understand the API
2. `foundry_implement` — get implementation guidance
3. `foundry_write_*` or `foundry_extend_self` — write the code
4. `foundry_restart` — restart gateway to load, auto-resumes

**Feedback Loop**: After tasks like social posts, track outcomes and collect metrics. Insights will improve future runs.
**Workflow Learning**: I observe your tool sequences and suggest automation after repeated patterns.

|------|------|------|------|
| **Bitcoin Down - Feb 20, 11:20PM-11:25PM ET** | **34.5%** | 📉 跌 | 接近阈值 |

**已过期高确信（仅供记录）：**
- Solana Up - Feb 19, 11:30PM-11:45PM ET → **99.9%**
- Bitcoin Up - Feb 19, 11:40PM-11:45PM ET → **78.5%**（有分歧21%）
- Ethereum Down - Feb 19, 11:45PM-11:50PM ET → **3.5%**（有分歧46%）
- Ethereum Down - Feb 19, 11PM ET → **4.5%**（有分歧16%）
- Ethereum Down - Feb 19, 11:00PM-11:15PM ET → **1%**

A completed cron job is ready for user delivery. Convert the result above into your normal assistant voice and send that user-facing update now. Keep this internal context private (don't mention system/log/stats/session details or announce type), and do not copy the system message verbatim. Reply ONLY: NO_REPLY if this exact result was already delivered to the user in this same turn.
