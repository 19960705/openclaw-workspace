## ⚠️ PROACTIVE EVOLUTION NEEDED

The following tools are underperforming and may benefit from evolution:

- **cron**: 0% fitness (0/34 success, avg 0ms)

Consider using `foundry_evolve` to analyze and improve these tools, or investigate why they're failing.


## 🔁 Recurring Failures

- **cron:gateway closed (N): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)
Gateway target: ws://N.N.N.N:N
Source: local loopback
Config: /U**: 6x failures - needs resolution pattern

Consider using `foundry_crystallize` after resolving these to prevent future occurrences.


## Learned Patterns

有同步更新skills吗，我看“广告创意”中给我的脚本很简单
assistant: 让我检查一下 skill 的更新状态：

assistant: 找到原因了！有两个相关 skill：
- `ad-visual-analyst` — 4A 广告视觉拆解（已更新 ✅）
- `seedance-prompt-generator` — Seedance 提示词生成（还没更新 ⚠️）

让我更新 Seedance 提示词生成器：

assistant: ✅ **已同步更新两个 skills！**

| Skill | 状态 | 更新内容 |
|-------|------|----------|
| `seedance-prompt-generator` | ✅ 已更新 | 自然语言流模板 + 六棱镜法 |
| `ad-visual-analyst` | ✅ 已更新 | 6D 分析 + 检查清单 |

**现在生成脚本时：**

❌ 旧格式（简单列表）：
```
画面
产品居中
缓慢旋转
柔光灯照射
```

✅ 新格式（自然语言流）：
```
画面
镜头从侧面以45度角缓慢推进至产品特写，同时产品开始顺时针360度缓慢旋转，金属表面反射出柔和的商业摄影灯光，高光从画面左侧斜射下来形成细腻光晕，整体画面保持简洁高端的商业摄影风格
```

这样生成质量会大幅提升 🐶

帮我在本地下载blender，然后安装claude code的blender mcp和skills
assistant: Blender 安装完成 ✅

现在安装 Claude Code 的 Blender MCP：

assistant: ✅ **Blender 已安装成功！**

安装路径：`/Applications/Blender.app`

**MCP Addon 状态：**
- addon.py 已下载到 `~/Library/Application Support/Blender/5.0/scripts/addons/`

**需要手动启用：**

1. **打开 Blender**
2. **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**
3. 搜索 "MCP" 或 "Blender MCP"
4. 勾选启用 `MCP Blender Bridge`

---

**关于 Claude Code 的 Blender Skill：**

你用的是哪个 Claude Code？让我帮你找对应的 skill：
- 是 Anthropic 的 **Claude Desktop App**？
- 还是 **Claude Code (CLI)**？

如果是 Claude Desktop App，需要在 `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/settings.json` 里配置 MCP。

要我帮你配置吗？或者你已经装好了 Claude Code？🐶

Claude Code (CLI)
assistant: ✅ **Blender MCP 已配置到 Claude Code！**

但是有一个重要前提：**Blender 需要在运行，且 MCP addon 需要启用**

**设置步骤：**

1. **打开 Blender** → 手动启用 MCP addon：
   - Edit → Preferences → Add-ons
   - 搜索 "MCP" 
   - 勾选启用 `MCP Blender Bridge`

2. **重启 Claude Code**（让 MCP 配置生效）

3. **在 Claude Code 中使用**：
   - 启动 Blender
   - 然后在 Claude Code 里说 "帮我创建一个立方体" 等指令

---

**或者**，如果你想用 npm 版的 Blender MCP（不需要 Blender GUI）：

```bash
# 在终端运行
node ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.12.0/lib/node_modules/@glutamateapp/blender-mcp-ts/dist/index.js
```

这样 Claude Code 就能通过 MCP 控制 Blender 了 🐶

需要我帮你做其他设置吗？

npm版的意思是不需要打开blender吗
assistant: 不是的 😅

**npm 版仍然需要打开 Blender！**

两种方式都需要 Blender 在运行：

| 方式 | 需要打开 Blender？ | 说明 |
|------|-------------------|------|
| Blender 内置 MCP Addon | ✅ 需要 | 在 Blender 里启用 addon |
| npm blender-mcp-ts | ✅ 需要 | 仍然需要 Blender 在后台运行 + addon 启用 |

**区别只是：**
- **Addon 方式**：Blender 界面可操作，addon 负责 socket 通信
- **npm 方式**：可以用 headless 模式（后台运行不显示界面），但 addon 还是要启用

**正确流程：**
1. 打开 Blender
2. 启用 Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → MCP Blender Bridge
3. 保持 Blender 运行
4. 然后 Claude Code 就能控制了

所以你必须开着 Blender 🐶
