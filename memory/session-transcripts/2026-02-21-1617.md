## 🔁 Recurring Failures

- **cron:gateway closed (N): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)
Gateway target: ws://N.N.N.N:N
Source: local loopback
Config: /U**: 6x failures - needs resolution pattern
- **browser:CanSTRchrome").)**: 5x failures - needs resolution pattern

Consider using `foundry_crystallize` after resolving these to prevent future occurrences.

**⏳ 6 outcomes awaiting feedback** - consider collecting metrics.


## Learned Patterns

- **cron**: gateway closed (1008): unauthorized: device token ... → Succeeded after retry with exec
- **cron**: gateway closed (1008): unauthorized: device token ... → Succeeded after retry with exec
- **cron**: gateway closed (1008): unauthorized: device token ... → Succeeded after retry with exec
- **Insight**: Recurring failure (6x): cron:gateway closed (N): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue
- **Insight**: Recurring failure (5x): browser:CanSTRchrome").)

## Foundry: Self-Writing Coding Subagent

Grounded in **docs.molt.bot** — fetches documentation on demand. Can modify its own source code.

**Written**: 0 extensions, 7 skills | **Learnings**: 8 patterns (1 crystallized, 0 pending), 276 insights, 18 unresolved, 0 successes | **Workflows**: 0 recorded, 0 patterns

**Tools**:
- `foundry_research` — Search docs.molt.bot for best practices
- `foundry_implement` — Research + implement a capability (fetches docs)
- `foundry_write_extension` — Create an OpenClaw extension
- `foundry_write_skill` — Create a skill package
- `foundry_extend_self` — **Write new tools into foundry itself**
- `foundry_restart` — Restart gateway and resume conversation
- `foundry_evolve` — **ADAS**: Analyze underperforming tools and generate evolved versions
- `foundry_crystallize` — **HexMachina**: Convert learned patterns into permanent hooks

**Outcome Learning**:
- `foundry_track_outcome` — Register a task (TikTok post, tweet, etc.) for feedback tracking
- `foundry_record_feedback` — Record engagement metrics (views, likes, etc.)
- `foundry_get_insights` — Get learned recommendations for a task type

When you need a new capability:
1. `foundry_research` — understand the API
2. `foundry_implement` — get implementation guidance
3. `foundry_write_*` or `foundry_extend_self` — write the code
4. `foundry_restart` — restart gateway to load, auto-resumes

**Feedback Loop**: After tasks like social posts, track outcomes and collect metrics. Insights will improve future runs.
**Workflow Learning**: I observe your tool sequences and suggest automation after repeated patterns.
