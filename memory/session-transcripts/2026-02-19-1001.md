## ⚠️ PROACTIVE EVOLUTION NEEDED

The following tools are underperforming and may benefit from evolution:

- **cron**: 15% fitness (6/40 success, avg 0ms)

Consider using `foundry_evolve` to analyze and improve these tools, or investigate why they're failing.


## 🔁 Recurring Failures

- **cron:gateway closed (N): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)
Gateway target: ws://N.N.N.N:N
Source: local loopback
Config: /U**: 6x failures - needs resolution pattern
- **browser:CanSTRchrome").)**: 4x failures - needs resolution pattern

Consider using `foundry_crystallize` after resolving these to prevent future occurrences.

**⏳ 6 outcomes awaiting feedback** - consider collecting metrics.


## Learned Patterns

- **web_search**: Validation failed for tool "web_search":... → Succeeded after retry with web_search
- **edit**: Found 2 occurrences of the text in /Users/mac/.ope... → Succeeded after retry with exec
- **web_search**: fetch failed... → Succeeded after retry with web_search

你阅读这篇文章，我想使用nvidia
assistant: ## OpenViking + NVIDIA 本地模型

可以使用 **vllm** 来用 NVIDIA GPU 跑本地模型：

```json
{
  "vlm": {
    "provider": "vllm",
    "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    "api_key": "dummy",
    "api_base": "http://localhost:8000/v1"
  }
}
```

---

**你有 NVIDIA GPU 吗？** 我可以帮你：

1. **安装 vLLM** - 用 NVIDIA 跑本地模型
2. **下载模型** - 如 Llama 3.1、Qwen 等
3. **配置 OpenViking** - 连接到本地模型

你的 Mac mini 是什么配置？（Intel 还是 Apple Silicon？M系列芯片？）

如果是 M 系列芯片，可以用 **MLX** 本地运行，不需要 NVIDIA 🐶

assistant: 太棒了！已经有现成的配置教程了！

## 🎯 OpenViking + NVIDIA 配置步骤

### 1. 获取 NVIDIA API Key
- 访问 https://build.nvidia.com/
- 注册/登录 → API Keys → Generate Key
- **免费** 可以用

### 2. 创建配置
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openviking
```

**配置内容 (`~/.openviking/ov.conf`):**
```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "dense": {
      "api_base": "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
      "api_key": "你的NVIDIA_API_KEY",
      "provider": "openai",
      "dimension": 4096,
      "model": "nvidia/nv-embed-v1"
    }
  },
  "vlm": {
    "api_base": "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
    "api_key": "你的NVIDIA_API_KEY",
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"
  }
}
```

### 3. 设置环境变量
```bash
export OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE=~/.openviking/ov.conf
```

M系列
assistant: M 系列 Mac 也能用 **NVIDIA NIM API**！它是云端服务，不看本地硬件。

## 两个方案

| 方案 | 费用 | 难度 |
|------|------|------|
| **NVIDIA NIM API** (云) | 免费额度 | 需要注册 |
| **本地 Ollama + MLX** | 免费 | 需要配置 |

---

**NVIDIA NIM 最简单：**
- 注册 https://build.nvidia.com/
- 获取免费 API Key
- 配置完就能用

你有 NVIDIA 账号吗？或者想用本地 MLX？🐶

- `foundry_evolve` — **ADAS**: Analyze underperforming tools and generate evolved versions
- `foundry_crystallize` — **HexMachina**: Convert learned patterns into permanent hooks

**Outcome Learning**:
- `foundry_track_outcome` — Register a task (TikTok post, tweet, etc.) for feedback tracking
- `foundry_record_feedback` — Record engagement metrics (views, likes, etc.)
- `foundry_get_insights` — Get learned recommendations for a task type

When you need a new capability:
1. `foundry_research` — understand the API
2. `foundry_implement` — get implementation guidance
3. `foundry_write_*` or `foundry_extend_self` — write the code
4. `foundry_restart` — restart gateway to load, auto-resumes

**Feedback Loop**: After tasks like social posts, track outcomes and collect metrics. Insights will improve future runs.
**Workflow Learning**: I observe your tool sequences and suggest automation after repeated patterns.
